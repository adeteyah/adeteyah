    With a background in design, I work closely with design focused teams to
    build websites and microsites for companies and individuals. I have years of
    experience working and collaborating on product teams and leading
    engineering efforts. With my experience in UI and product engineering, I
    solve product problems and build appealing usable web experiences.
