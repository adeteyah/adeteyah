        With a background in design, I work closely with design focused teams to
        build websites and microsites for companies and individuals. I have
        years of experience working and collaborating on product teams and
        leading engineering efforts. With my experience in UI and product
        engineering, I solve product problems and build appealing usable web
        experiences.
