      With a background in design, I work closely with design focused teams to
      build websites and microsites for companies and individuals. I have years
      of experience working and collaborating on product teams and leading
      engineering efforts. With my experience in UI and product engineering, I
      solve product problems and build appealing usable web experiences.
